### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python



```python
2 + 24
```




    26




```python
34 * 45 ^4
```




    1534




```python
(3*4)+5
## This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.
```




    17




```python
##  This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
min_200 = 200
min_in_h = 200 / 60
min_in_h
```
